            <div class="p1">Ash Ketchum (Japanese: サトシ Satoshi) is the main character of my favourite cartoon, Pokémon. He was also featured in various manga based on the anime, such as "The Electric Tale of Pikachu", "Ash & Pikachu", and "Pocket Monsters Diamond & Pearl".
            </div>
            <div class="p2">  He's a Pokémon Trainer hailing Pallet Town wanting to become a Pokémon Master. 
                        <br>His starter was a Pikachu, though I hoped he could've picked Charmander. 
                        <br>On his journeys around the world, he's been accompanied by a multitude of close friends. 
                        <br>In Sun & Moon, he finally becomes a Champion of the Alola region. 
                        <br>In Pokémon Journeys, he becomes one of the eight best Trainers in the world within the World Coronation Series.

            </div>
            <div class="p3">He shares his Japanese name with the creator of the Pokémon franchise, Satoshi Tajiri. His English surname is a pun of the English motto, "Gotta catch 'em all!. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuYeHPFR3f0">[CLICK ME!]</a>"
