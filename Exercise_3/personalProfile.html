            <p inherit-class="">Ash Ketchum (Japanese: サトシ Satoshi) is the main character of my favourite cartoon, Pokémon. He was also featured in various manga based on the anime, such as "The Electric Tale of Pikachu", "Ash & Pikachu", and "Pocket Monsters Diamond & Pearl".
            </p>
            <p>He's a Pokémon Trainer hailing Pallet Town wanting to become a Pokémon Master. His starter was a Pikachu, though I hoped he could've picked Charmander. On his journeys around the world, he's been accompanied by a multitude of close friends. <br>
            In Sun & Moon, he finally becomes a Champion of the Alola region. In Pokémon Journeys: The Series, he becomes one of the eight best Trainers in the world within the World Coronation Series.
            </p>
            <p>He shares his Japanese name with the creator of the Pokémon franchise, Satoshi Tajiri. His English surname is a pun of the English motto, "Gotta catch 'em all!."
